#Newton's Cradle (WhiteHat Jr Project-27)
*Newton's Cradle aptly demonstrates the principle of the conservation of momentum (mass times speed). This principle states that when two objects collide, the total momentum of the objects before the collision is equal to the total momentum of the objects after the collision.*
